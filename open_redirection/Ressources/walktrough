Open redirection vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows user-supplied input to control URL redirection without proper validation.

Attackers can use open redirects to bypass security policies such as Same-Origin Policy, which is crucial for preventing certain types of attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

By changing the redirect by http://192.168.1.32/index.php?page=redirect&site=whatever
The website write this message: "Good Job Here is the flag : b9e775a0291fed784a2d9680fcfad7edd6b8cdf87648da647aaf4bba288bcab3"

To avoid open redirection, ensure that the redirection parameter is validated against a list of allowed values or patterns.
